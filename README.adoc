A small, fast, colorful, asynchronous, type-safe C++ logging library. Uses libuv.

Example output:

Go ahead and copy files from this repo. Then include log.h somewhere in your
project, for example:

    #include "al/log.h"

Initialize. The logger will be automatically uninitialized at the end of the
scope, when `raii` is destructed.

    al::Scoped_Log_Init raii;

== Unconditional logging:

Each message includes time and severity, with an added color. Check log.cpp to
change the escape codes used for each severity.

Prints "Hello, World" as an error

    al::log_e("Hello, World!");

Prints the warning `Player at (5.0, 12.0, 1.0)`

    glm::vec3 pos(5.0f, 12.0f, 1.0f);
    al::log_w("Player at (%, %, %)", pos.x, pos.y, pos.z);

Prints "Hello, World" as debug information

    al::log_d("%, %", "Hello", "World");

Anything that supports to_string works in the % replacement!

== Conditional logging:

These messages can be turned off by defining `AL_DISABLE_LOGGING` before
including log.h.

Logs "Hello, Luke" as "information".

    // Log a conditional information message the same way, C strings work too!
    const char *const player_name = "Luke";
    AL_LOG_I("Hello, %", player_name);

= Translation:

Load in a mapping from semantic strings to strings in a language

    #include "al/translate.h"

    al::Lang lang;
    lang.dict.push_back({"greeting", "Nice to meet you, %!"});

    al::set_lang(lang);

Build the actual message using replacement featured earlier:

    std::string message = al::t("greeting", "Luke");

Or if you want to be more explicit:

    std::string message = al::translate("greeting", "Luke");

No matter which you chose, message now equals "Nice to meet you, Luke".
